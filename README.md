# QuizoffApp

This is an "quiz off" application meant for individual competition of Christian & Missionary Alliance (CMA) Bible Quizzing for the selection of the international team.  Although originally developed given the quiz-off rules used by the Western Great Lakes District (WGLD), it's possibly to use it in different configurations.

The primary (current) use is as a scoreboard, seen below, on a monitor or projection screen, together with a scorekeeping page.

Important features include:

 - Individual pictures, names, score
 - Quiz-out shown with a green background.
 - Errors shown on the card, and error-outs as a red background.

## WGLD Quiz-off Rules

The quiz-off consists of the following modifications:

 - The quiz consists of up to 10 quizzers and 20 "numbered" questions.
 - Each error is -10 points and the quizzer sits out the next question.  At 3 errors, the quizzer is out for the remainder of that quiz.
 - Quizzers continue to quiz in successive quizzes until they accumulate a total of 200 points.  The first 5 quizzers to make it to 200 points will be the Internationals team.  This may mean 6+ quizzes must take place until the 5 spots have been filled.

## Scoring Page
